# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

A prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers, but due to the large number exisiting cryptocurrencies, some work must be done to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. Unsupervised machine learning is applied. Using K-means, the number of clusters was identified as 4. THe clusters of the cryptocurrencies were visualized using 3D scatter plot. Finally, the total number of cois mined was also identified and visualized using a 2d sctter plot. The  data is ready to be viewed by the bank and decisions can be made using these plots.
